This dashboard for the 2017 Honda CRV has its speedometer on the right-hand side, showing the speed in both km/p in the larger circle and mph in the smaller circle. The parking brake symbol can be found at the bottom of this side. Not lit is oil change light, the airbag light, the battery light, and the car security light. The tachometer is on the left and has the check engine light, the engine overheating light, the abs light, and a steering wheel lock light. On the bottom you can see the fuel level as well as the total miles on the engine and the total distance since the trip was reset. The dashboard shows whether the car is in park, reverse, neutral, or a stage of drive. In between the two dials. Below this there are lights for traction control, seatbelt, and AT, which shows that the car is in automatic transmission. To change the brightness of the lights, a knob is used on the left of the dash. A button is used on the  to reset the trip and change it from trip a to trip b or vice versa.

Pros
- The fuel gauge is easy to see, being in the middle of the dashboard.
- The car has both km/h and mph in the speedometer
- all the lights are concise places
- has a light for security

Cons
- the dashboard only shows red, with green for the driving position. People with red/green colorblindness would have problem properly reading this dashboard.
- There is no way to see the temperature of the engine until it is overheating
- does not have the option to show gas mileage or distance until empty
- the lights are crowded and could be spaced out better
- I would prefer if the fuel display were near the top, since having it there would reduce the amount time someoneâ€™s eyes are off the road

This dash is for a 2019 ford explorer. This dash has two lcd screens to the side of the speedometer. The one one the left shows several screens for different features, with the main one showing the distance to empty of the tank as well as a visual representation of the amount of fuel in the tank. This screen can also be used to show fuel economy, trip 1 and 2 information, driver assist and other settings. The right lcd shows the navigation panel, as well the option to see entertainment settings and the phone connetion. This screen also shows outside tempature, the compass direction and the current time. Both screens are interacted with by using a directional pad in the steering wheel, one for the for each side. The speedometer shows both MPH and KM/h. Below this the current driving mode is shown. Located below the left lcd screen are the lights for the the front and back fog lamps and ABS. The speedometer had the directional blinker lights and the light for high beams. The right side has the lights for parking break, an electric parking break fault light, airbag, seatbelt, and check engine light.

Pros
- There are alot of option that allow the user to customize their car to how they desire
- The dash board would not be hard to read is the user is colorblind
- having the navagation show up on the dash borad helps reduce the amount of time the user looks away from the road.
- the speedometer is very large and easy to read
- having the outside tempature and the time of day eaisly accessible is very useful

Cons
- all the lcd screens could be hard on the users eyes at night
- there is no tachometer and no way to see that information
- the amount of options avaiable on the left screen is large, anc can be confusing
- with so much that can be done while driving, this could take the users attention from the road
- there is no way to see the engine temp, until the warning light turns on.
