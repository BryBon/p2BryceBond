This dashboard for the 2017 Honda CRV has its speedometer on the right-hand side, showing the speed in both km/p in the larger circle and mph in the smaller circle. The parking brake symbol can be found at the bottom of this side. Not lit is oil change light, the airbag light, the battery light, and the car security light. The tachometer is on the left and has the check engine light, the engine overheating light, the abs light, and a steering wheel lock light. On the bottom you can see the fuel level as well as the total miles on the engine and the total distance since the trip was reset. The dashboard shows whether the car is in park, reverse, neutral, or a stage of drive. In between the two dials. Below this there are lights for traction control, seatbelt, and AT, which shows that the car is in automatic transmission. To change the brightness of the lights, a knob is used on the left of the dash. A button is used on the right of the dash to reset the trip and change it from trip a to trip b or vice versa.

Pros
- The fuel gauge is easy to see, being in the middle of the dashboard.
- The car has both km/h and mph in the speedometer
- all the lights are concise places
- has a light for security

Cons
- the dashboard only shows red, with green for the driving position. People with red/green colorblindness would have problem properly reading this dashboard.
- There is no way to see the temperature of the engine until it is overheating
- does not have the option to show gas mileage or distance until empty
- the lights are crowded and could be spaced out better
- I would prefer if the fuel display were near the top, since having it there would reduce the amount time someone’s eyes are off the road

This dash is for a 2019 ford explorer. This dash has two lcd screens to the side of the speedometer. The one the left shows several screens for different features, with the main one showing the distance to empty of the tank as well as a visual representation of the amount of fuel in the tank. This screen can also be used to show fuel economy, trip 1 and 2 information, driver assist and other settings. The right lcd shows the navigation panel, as well the option to see entertainment settings and the phone connection. This screen also shows outside temperature, the compass direction, and the current time. Both screens are interacted with by using a directional pad in the steering wheel, one for the for each side and voice controls. The speedometer shows both MPH and KM/h. Below this the current driving mode is shown. Located below the left lcd screen are the lights for the front and back fog lamps and ABS. The speedometer had the directional blinker lights and the light for high beams. The right side has the lights for parking brake, an electric parking brake fault light, airbag, seatbelt, and traction control light at the bottom with tire pressure warning light at the top. The brightness can be changed from the setting menu.

Pros
- There are a lot of option that allow the user to customize their car to how they desire
- The dashboard would not be hard to read is the user is colorblind
- having the navigation show up on the dashboard helps reduce the amount of time the user looks away from the road.
- the speedometer is very large and easy to read
- having the outside temperature and the time of day easily accessible is very useful

Cons
- all the lcd screens could be hard on the users’ eyes at night
- there is no tachometer and no way to see that information
- the number of options available on the left screen is large, and can be confusing
- with so much that can be done while driving, this could take the users attention from the road
- there is no way to see the engine temp, until the warning light turns on.
- does not show fuel level unless panel is on the fuel panel

### Unknown Car

![Image from Unknown Car](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BryBon/p2BryceBond/main/Unknown%20car.png)

  This car has three main dial sections. The far left dial section has a dial for fuel level, the engine tempature, and an indactor of the driving mode. The middle section has the speedometer, a display of the total miles and the miles on the trip, and a display for the outside temp. The far right dial contains the tachometer and most of the cars warning lights. The dark black sections most likely contain the light used in operation of the car, like the blinkers signal lights. There is a button on the bottom to reset the trip milage.
  
 Pros
 - Very simple to use
 - easy to read, should not cause problems for colorblind users
 - buttons seem to be placed in themed places
 - no lcds might help users driving at night

Cons
- very simple, missing most modern day features like gas miliage
- the driving mode indacter should be moved to a more central spot
- there does not seem to be a way to change the brightness of the backlighting

  This dashboard has two main dial section seperated by an lcd panel and four minor dials. The far left dial is the tachometer. Right dial is the speedometer. The top four dial in order are oil pressure, coolant tempature, fuel level, and transmission tempature. Under the tachometer, there are the lights for the abs, the parking brake, the aribag indactor, and low tire pressure. The lights under the speedometer are the seatbelt warning, the check engine light, traction control, and traction control off. The center led panel has the ability to show fuel effencey and miles until empty, engine tempature, the pitch and roll of the vehicle as well as what drive trains are doing work, and a limited amount of settings. To the upper left and right of the lcd panel are where the blinker lights are shown. Below the panel is where the  drive mode is shown. the brightness of the lights can be changed by a dial and button to the left of the dashboard. The lcd panel is controlled by a directional pad on the steering wheel.
  
 Pros
 - Shows the engine temp as a dial and on the lcd panel
 - fuel dial is near the top of the dash, letting the user glance at the dial and maintain more attention on the road 
 - is simple enough to use for new users while also providing more in depth features for more complicated tasks

Cons
- missing warning light for things like low oil pressure for those that do not know what the dials mean
- the two dials for coolant tempature and transmission tempature
- the images under the top dials could be moved so they do not get covered when the dial is striaght down 
- the tachometer shold have an indacator for when the RPM of the engine is too high
- compass and outdoor tempature is on the center consle

### Tesla Dashboard

![Image of Tesla Dash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BryBon/p2BryceBond/main/Tesla%20.png)

This dashboard is entireley digital. This allows the user to customize their dashboard experience as much as they want . This has the side effect of poetentially causeing the user to not know how to properly operate the car. The daqshboard is controled by the steering wheel buttons, voice control, or via a touch screen. 

Pros
- the users can customize thir experience as much as they want
- can allow for more indepth information to be avaiable at a moments notice

Cons
- touch screen controls can be hard to hit and could cause distractions to the users
- since the screen is entirely digital, if there is either software or techinal faults, the screen might not turn on
- the amount of options and controls can be confusing for new users

## Improvements

I will be slightly redesigning the dshboard from my truck. Out of the five that were covered, this one fits my idea of a perfect dashboard the most. I will be keeping the speedometer, tachometer and lcd panel in roughly the same places. For the top four dials, I am going to remove the transmission tempature dial and only have three dials; one for oil pressure, one for fuel, and one for coolant tempature. I am also going to move the symbols for those dials above the dial so the image is always shown. Since this dashboard does not include warnings for the top four dials, I am going to include one. To do this the symbols above the dials in my design will light up when those warnings are needed. For the digital panels, I do not want to change much. I do not use most of the panels, but I can see where they could be useful to others. I am going to include the compass and outside temp on the bottom of the interface. the top panel displays the gauge information, but only the engine temp. I will move this into the truck app section. I am also going to include a panel for navigation that will be intereacted with using voice commands.
