#Car Dashboards

Car%20.png

This dashboard for a 2017 Honda CRV has its speedometer on the right-hand side, showing the speed in both km/p in the larger circle and mph in the smaller circle. The parking brake symbol can be found at the bottom of this side. Not lit is oil change light, the airbag light, the battery light, and the car security light. The tachometer is on the left and has the check engine light, the engine overheating light, the abs light, and a steering wheel lock light. On the bottom you can see the fuel level as well as the total miles on the engine and the total distance since the trip was reset. The dashboard shows whether the car is in park, reverse, neutral, or a stage of drive. In between the two dials. Below this there are lights for traction control, seatbelt, and AT, which shows that the car is in automatic transmission. 

Pros
- The fuel gauge is easy to see, being in the middle of the dashboard.
- The car has both km/h and mph in the speedometer
- all the lights are concise places

Cons
- the dashboard only shows red, with green for the driving position. People with red/green colorblindness would have problem properly reading this dashboard.
- There is no way to see the temperature of the engine until it is overheating
- does not have the option to show gas mileage or distance until empty
- the lights are crowded and could be spaced out better
- I would prefer if the fuel display were near the top, since having it there would reduce the amount time someoneâ€™s eyes are off the road
